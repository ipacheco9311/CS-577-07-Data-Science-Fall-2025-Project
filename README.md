# Instructions
__________

You will complete a semester project. 
The first step of the project is a Project Proposal. 
See the PDF for instructions on creating your project proposal.

Project proposals are due ***Tuesday, September 23***.

You are expected to work in groups of 2-3. 
You may work alone if your project is tied to an academic research project, or tied to work for an internship or job. 
If your project is tied to work with an internship or job, 
you must get permission from your employer to share your data for the purposes of grading, 
and permission to present your results to the class. 
You may also work alone for similar compelling reasons. 
Groups may not be larger than 3.

All students must submit their own copy of the proposal on Canvas, including the names of your project partners. 
If your group has 3 people in it, all 3 of you must submit a copy of the same proposal on Canvas.
