    "This scatter-matrix visualizes pairwise relationships among bathrooms, bedrooms, price, and square_feet.\n",

    "#### Bathrooms ↔ Bedrooms\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong positive association — homes with more bedrooms generally have more bathrooms.\n",
    "The relationship appears step-like rather than smooth, since both are discrete integer features.\n",
    "Sparse points for high values (≥6 bedrooms, ≥4 bathrooms) reflect rare, high-end homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bathrooms ↔ Square Feet\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear positive trend — as house size increases, bathroom count rises.\n",
    "The data form vertical clusters due to rounding in square footage (e.g., multiples of 500 or 1000 ft²).\n",
    "A few extreme points near 10,000–12,000 ft² expand the scale, showing luxury properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bedrooms ↔ Square Feet\n",

    "#### Price ↔ Square Feet\n",

    "Clear nonlinear positive pattern — price rises with square footage but with large variability.\n",
    "Most observations lie below 2000 ft², where prices are tightly clustered.\n",
    "The upper tail (prices above 20,000) shows a few high-end properties that stretch the scale.\n",

    "### Overall Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This scatter-matrix shows pairwise relationships among bathrooms, bedrooms, price_log, and square_feet_log.\n",
    "After applying log transformations to continuous features, relationships that were previously nonlinear and skewed now appear smoother and more proportional.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bathrooms ↔ Bedrooms\n",
    "\n",
    "Still a strong positive ordinal relationship — homes with more bedrooms generally include more bathrooms.\n",
    "The step-like structure remains since both variables are discrete integers.\n",
    "Higher bedroom/bathroom combinations (≥6 bedrooms, ≥4 bathrooms) remain sparse and scattered — these are rare, high-value homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bathrooms ↔ Square Feet (log)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear linear relationship: as home size increases, the number of bathrooms grows in roughly proportional steps.\n",
    "The vertical clustering seen before has reduced; the log scale compresses large square-footage differences.\n",
    "Outliers are far less extreme, showing improved scaling and distribution balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bedrooms ↔ Square Feet (log)\n",
    "\n",
    "Still a tight positive association with clearer proportionality than in the raw data.\n",
    "Densest region is centered around 2–3 bedrooms and log(square_feet) ≈ 6.5–7.2, corresponding to ~700–1300 ft².\n",
    "Larger properties (≥7 bedrooms) appear as upper-end discrete clusters — consistent with rare, luxury homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price (log) ↔ Square Feet (log)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the strongest and most linear relationship in the matrix.\n",
    "Points form a clear diagonal cluster — as square_feet_log increases, price_log rises proportionally.\n",
    "The log transform effectively reduces the influence of extreme prices, revealing a consistent scaling trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price (log) ↔ Bedrooms / Bathrooms\n",
    "\n",
    "Both show positive but weaker relationships than with square footage.\n",
    "For small to medium homes (1–3 bedrooms), price distributions overlap heavily.\n",
    "Marginal price gains per additional bedroom or bathroom appear smaller at higher counts — indicating diminishing returns in larger homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Axis-Bound Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "x-axes: discrete ranges (0–9) for bedrooms/bathrooms; continuous logs for price and square footage.\n",
    "y-axes: smoother and compressed compared to the raw plot — extreme high-end outliers no longer dominate.\n",
    "The clustering along diagonals reflects log-linear scaling, consistent with housing market data patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Log transformation successfully linearized and stabilized relationships among continuous variables.\n",
    "price_log and square_feet_log now display a clear proportional relationship ideal for regression or clustering.\n",
    "Discrete variables (bedrooms, bathrooms) retain ordinal structure and correlate logically with continuous ones.\n",
    "Data are now better balanced — reduced skew, consistent scales, and fewer distortions."
